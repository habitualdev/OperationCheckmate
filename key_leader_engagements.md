Summary:
Conducted three key leader engagements (KLE) across area of operations.

Ghufran: Friendly meeting with town elder. Leadership cooperative and open to collaboration. Intelligence received indicates Taliban spotters likely monitoring our base, potential surveillance threat.

Yafiah: Engagement with local leader Jawadi. Expressed willingness to provide intelligence in exchange for civil ai; specifically, restoration or construction of water wells.

Third Meeting: Convoy ambushed inside town during meeting. Contact broken; situation under review.

Assessment:
Local sentiment largely cooperative with potential for information flow via civic support. Heightened threat awareness required due to confirmed surveillance and ambush activity. 

Recommend increased base security measures and follow-up on well project to secure Jawadiâ€™s cooperation
