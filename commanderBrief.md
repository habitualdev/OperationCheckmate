# Commander’s Overview — Operation: **Checkmate**

**Area:** Reshman Province
**Zoom:** Tactical (planning focus: regional / population centers & passes)

---

## Intent & Mission Commander's Intent

Our strategic aim is to collapse the Taliban Reshman Shura’s command-and-control and logistics capability in the province while minimizing collateral damage and preserving local cooperation. D Squadron’s mission is to conduct precision, intelligence-driven direct-action and special reconnaissance to enable broader coalition effects: capture/neutralize key leadership nodes (priority: deny command), disrupt weapons/drug networks, and secure key population centers for ANA/ANP consolidation.

**Success looks like:** leadership decapitation or disruption (denying operational cohesion), supply artery interdiction (Timora Pass / Kezban), and handing secured areas with intact civil infrastructure to friendly forces and local partners.

## Rationale for SAS Tasking (Command-level Note)

D Squadron, 22 SAS, has been designated the lead SOF element for this tranche due to mission‑specific advantages and coalition force allocation. SAS brings specialized capability in long‑range reconnaissance, covert infiltration, and precision capture operations in rugged and urban terrain—skills that match the intelligence‑led, low‑signature approach required in Reshman. Additionally, existing HUMINT linkages and local liaison relationships under UK auspices reduce our operational risk and shorten targeting timelines. Theatre political and legal considerations, together with the need to retain US conventional and persistent ISR/air assets for higher‑priority theater tasks, further support a UK SOF lead. Employing SAS also demonstrates coalition burden‑sharing while minimizing political exposure and preserving flexibility for capture‑first exploitation.

## High‑Level Objectives (Priorities)

* **Protect force & civilians** — minimize own casualties and noncombatant harm.
* **Intelligence First** — identify reliable HVT locations and validate them before kinetic action. (GHOST status uncertain — treat as intel priority.)
* **Disrupt logistics nodes** — Kezban (weapons), Timora Pass (routes), Dishad Bazaar (funding).
* **Enable partners** — coordinate with ANA/ANP and USMC assets for sustainable hold and follow‑on.
* **Preserve deniability & local support** — capture where possible for exploitation; avoid heavy collateral effects.

---

## Operational Environment — Key Considerations

* **Terrain:** Rugged mountainous areas (Timora Mountains/Pass), mixed urban centers (Kallista, Dilshad, Kezban), and lakes/rivers on the eastern edge. Lines of sight vary dramatically; expect complex concealment and limited vehicle mobility in high ground.
* **Population Centers:** Kallista and Dilshad are population/commerce hubs; operate with heightened ROE and intel vetting.
* **Road Network:** Sparse strategic roads link hubs; passes are choke points used by insurgent logistics.
* **Weather/Visibility:** Can influence helicopter support and foot insertion; plan for degraded CAS/QRF timelines.
* **Local Actors:** Mixed reliability — Commander Karim (cooperative) is a high‑value liaison; Malik Sadiq is unreliable.

### Tribal Elders — Local Influence & Handling Guidance

* **Karim Jawadi — Yafiah (Sides with profit):** Influential local merchant-elder who prioritizes economic advantage over ideology. Can be swayed by incentives or lucrative contracts; useful for sourcing local labor, market access, and indirect intel if compensated. Treat him as a pragmatic asset — leverage economic incentives carefully but verify information independently (he may trade intel to the highest bidder).
* **Hasan Haidari — Jabirah (Suspected sympathizer):** Local elder with ties and sympathies that may lean toward insurgent elements. Approach with extreme caution: restrict sensitive disclosures, corroborate any claims through SIGINT/other HUMINT, and avoid unilateral operations based solely on his input. Use surveillance and vetting before engagement.
* **Qadeer Bahadur — Ghufran (Ardent NATO Supporter):** Loyal pro‑coalition elder and valuable partner for community access and legitimacy. Can assist in outreach, recruitment vetting, and stabilisation efforts. Protect his identity and movements where possible, as his open support makes him a target for retaliation.

## Friendly & Support Assets

* **USMC:** Air support, QRF, MEDEVAC (limited — QRF 30–45 min). Coordinate air requests early.
* **ANA / ANP / Local Police:** Hold population centers, provide local intelligence and presence; variable capability — vet and support as required.
* **Local Liaison:** Commander Karim — primary trusted contact; use to validate human intelligence.

---

## Rules of Engagement & Legal/Ethical Constraints

* **ROE:** Capture preferred where practical for intelligence exploitation. Use lethal force only when necessary. Avoid strikes in or near crowded markets or known civilian infrastructure unless threat is imminent.
* **Detention:** If capturing, ensure procedures for interrogation, documentation, and transfer to authorized facilities.
* **Protection of Civilians:** Avoid heavy ordnance; clearly mark friendly positions to reduce fratricide.

---

## Intelligence & Reconnaissance

* **ISR First:** Use SR teams and overwatch to confirm HVT presence. Deny reliance on single‑source HUMINT — require at least two corroborating streams (local liaison + SIG/visual).
* **Surveillance Windows:** Night reconnaissance for camp/compound signatures; monitor movement patterns in Timora Pass during dawn/dusk.
* **Exploitation:** Prioritize live capture where possible for actionable intel (networks, safehouses, funding routes).

---

## Synchronization & Coordination

* **Air Requests:** Submit CAS/QRF requests with conservative timelines; prepare for degraded response.
* **Partner Handover:** Plan phases where you clear and secure a node, then transition to ANA/ANP with coalition support standing by.
* **Communications:** Maintain comms discipline. Establish primary, alternate, contingency channels and predetermined rendezvous points.

---

## Phasing & Tempo (Conceptual)

1. **Shape (SR & Intel):** Small reconnaissance elements confirm presence of HVTs, supply caches, and secure infiltration/exfiltration routes.
2. **Fix (Isolation & Deception):** Use limited actions to isolate objective area (block key exit routes; coordinate partner roadblocks).
3. **Strike (Direct Action):** Conduct fast, precise raids on validated targets with extraction plan. Prefer capture; escalate to lethal only when necessary.
4. **Stabilize (Transition):** Assist ANA/ANP to hold nodes; conduct civil‑safety checks and facilitate humanitarian/aid where appropriate.
5. **Exploit & Disseminate:** Rapidly process captured intelligence and pass to province/coalition intel for follow‑on targeting.

> **Note:** These are conceptual phases for mission planning — do not assume sequence rigidly; adapt to real‑time intel.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

* **Ambush/IED:** High risk near supply hubs and passes. Use dismounted routes, standoff detection, and counter‑IED procedures.
* **Civilian Casualties:** Moderate in markets and urban centers. Mitigate via ISR, precision, and non‑lethal options.
* **Delayed QRF/MEDEVAC:** Prepare field casualty plans and self‑sufficient medical capability for 30–45+ minutes.
* **Compromise of Local Assets:** Vet informants (Malik Sadiq unreliable). Use trusted contacts (Karim) for sensitive ops.

---

## Logistics & Sustainment

* **Self‑sustain:** Carry enough supplies for operations without immediate resupply.
* **Exfil/Resupply Points:** Pre‑coordinate USMC support pickup zones; avoid predictable patterns.
* **Medical:** Designate a Tactical Casualty Collection Point and medevac priority schema.

---

## IMINT / COMINT / HUMINT Exploitation

* **Collection Priority:** Communications nodes, weapons caches (Kezban), funding sources (Dishad Bazaar), leadership nodes (possible GHOST locations).
* **Processing:** Rapid exploitation of captured devices; immediate dissemination to coalition intel.
* **Deconfliction:** Ensure all sensitive exploitation activities are logged and coordinated with coalition legal/intel authorities.

---

## Command & Control

* **Chain:** SAS retains ROE decision authority in field within higher commander’s intent.
* **Reporting:** Immediate Battle Damage / Intel reports after engagements (SITREP format) — include civilian impact and detainee status.
* **Decision Points:** Capture vs. kill thresholds, escalation criteria for requesting CAS, and handover thresholds to ANA.
