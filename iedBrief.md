# IED Threat Brief — Reshman Province (Tactical)

**Purpose:** Provide SAS with an actionable, defensive‑focused overview of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) threat, likely tactics, indicators, immediate actions, and mitigation measures in the Reshman AO. This brief focuses on force protection, detection, reporting, exploitation, and partner coordination — **not** on device construction or employment.

---

## 1. Threat Overview

* Insurgent elements in Reshman employ IEDs routinely and **in combination with complex ambushes**.
* Preferred employment: roadside IEDs (VBIEDs, buried/secondary charges), pressure/command‑detonated devices, and **multi‑device ambush arrays** (initial blast to halt/soften, follow‑on charges to target responders).
* Terrain exploitation: narrow passes, steep approaches, culverts, chokepoints, hairpin bends, bridges, and predictable coalition routes (supply and patrol lanes).
* Temporal patterns: increased use at dawn/dusk and during curated lulls in patrol patterns; spikes after successful insurgent intel on movement schedules.

---

## 2. Likely IED Emplacement Sites & Signatures

High‑probability emplacement sites (prioritise these during route reconnaissance):

* **Pass approaches & choke points:** hairpins, narrow defiles, one‑lane sections.
* **Bridges & culverts:** concealment under structure or in drainage.
* **Road shoulders & berms:** disturbed ground, fresh fill, stacked rocks.
* **Market entrances / bazaars adjacent roadways:** secondary devices or spectator concealment.
* **Vegetation and rock outcrops overlooking route:** command wires or observation posts.
* **Parked vehicles/abandoned caches near route:** potential VBIED staging.
* **Utility boxes/fences/signposts:** affixed or disguised devices.

Visual indicators:

* Freshly disturbed soil, fresh gravel, or new vegetation cuttings.
* Recently placed rocks, stones, or concrete slabs.
* Tape, string, wires, loose cables, or unexpected conduit.
* Unusual containers (buckets, jerrycans) tied to roadside obstacles.
* Electrical tape, exposed connectors, or switches on roadside objects.
* New or out‑of‑place roadside trash piles or animal carcasses used as concealment.
* Locally unusual behavior: individuals observing movements, recording with phones, or repeated traffic pattern sampling.

---

## 3. Typical Insurgent TTPs (Observed / Anticipated)

* **Complex ambush sequence:** initial IED to disable/stop convoy → small arms ambush on halted troops → secondary IEDs targeted at responders and medevac.
* **Multiple initiation methods:** pressure/pressure‑plate, command‑detonated (linear wire or RF), and victim‑operated disguised devices.
* **Use of civilians/market cover:** weapons and triggering assets hidden among civilian structures to complicate clearance.
* **Standoff kill boxes:** preplaced devices at chokepoints to funnel movement into kill zones.
* **Decoy & distraction devices:** fake IEDs to draw responders into prepared ambush fields.
* **Use of reconnaissance assets:** spotters in high ground to observe movements and trigger devices at optimal moments.

## 4. Immediate Actions on Suspicion / Encounter (Doctrinal, Defensive)

> **Do NOT touch or disturb suspected device.** Follow EOD/engineer guidance and national SOPs.

1. **Stop movement — maintain standoff.** Halt vehicle movement and dismount only if safe and required by SOP.
2. **Mark and control the area.** Establish immediate cordon and prevent all foot traffic; move civilians away at a safe distance.
3. **Notify:** Call immediate IED/EOD report (radio/net) with location (grid), description, device indicators, and any combatants observed. Use codewords per unit SOP.
4. **Do not attempt neutralisation.** Only qualified EOD/engineer teams should approach.
5. **Establish overwatch and security.** Position elements to observe likely enemy approaches and deny ambush positions; be mindful of secondary device risk.
6. **Prepare casualty & extraction:** designate casualty collection point (CCP) and medevac plan; expect delayed QRF.
7. **Record evidence:** Photograph from standoff if safe; note vehicle serials, registration, or suspicious markings. Preserve for exploitation.

## 5. Patrol & Route Mitigation Measures (Tactical Guidance)

* **Route discipline & unpredictability:** vary timing, routes, formations, and speed profiles to deny predictable patterns.
* **Advance recon:** use dismounted reconnaissance, UAV/drone overwatch, and engineer reconnaissance prior to high‑value movement.
* **Route hardening:** push traffic off predictable centerlines where terrain and CPO allow; avoid hugging roadside obstructions.
* **Use of standoff observation:** maintain overwatch on high slopes and likely enemy vantage points during movement.
* **Cordon & clear before movement through chokepoints:** when possible, clear main chokepoints with engineer assets prior to convoy passage.
* **Limit stationary exposure in high‑risk sectors:** minimise time stopped in passes and narrow roads; if stopped, secure 360° with immediate counterfire plans.
* **Vehicle formation:** use buffer vehicles to detect/trigger pressure devices from safe platform (per unit SOP), but do not improvise; use approved tactics only.
* **Civil engagement:** use local liaison (e.g., Qadeer Bahadur) to gather HUMINT on unusual activity near routes.

---

## 6. Counter‑IED Support & Coordination

* **EOD / Engineers:** Task EOD teams for confirmation, render‑safe, and exploitation. Provide route clearance priority for high‑use coalition routes.
* **UAV/SIGINT:** Use ISR to detect suspicious activity and to overwatch suspected emplacement sites. Coordinate collection windows with D Squadron.
* **K‑9 / Thermal:** If available, employ K‑9 teams and thermal imaging to detect disturbed ground or concealed objects.
* **Local forces / Liaison:** Vet and integrate reliable local assets (Qadeer Bahadur, Commander Karim) for HUMINT leads; treat unverified tips cautiously.
* **Forensic exploitation:** Ensure EOD collects device components for technical exploitation (TCAT/EBT); pass results to intel for pattern analysis.

---

## 7. Reporting & Exploitation Templates

**Immediate IED Report (Minimum):**

* Time / Date (UTC)
* Grid / Lat‑Long (precise)
* Nearest town/landmark (e.g., Timora Pass, Kezban road, km marker)
* Device type (suspected: roadside, VBIED, pressure, command) — *do not attempt to identify internal components*
* Visible indicators (wires, disturbed soil, containers)
* Friendly posture & casualties (if any)
* Enemy contact / ambush indicators (small arms, RPG, observed positions)
* Actions taken (cordon, EOD called, medevac requested)
* Witnesses / local civilians detained for questioning (if any)

**Post‑Event SITREP (follow‑on):**

* Explosive effects and damage assessment
* Forensic results / EOD initial findings (when available)
* Intelligence exploitation outcomes (HUMINT/SIGINT linkages)
* Recommended route status (clear/unclear), required follow‑on actions

---

## 8. Medical & Casualty Considerations

* **Expect blast + fragmentation injuries;** prepare for severe trauma and burns.
* **Treat and triage at CCP:** maintain tourniquets, massive transfusion capability if available.
* **MEDEVAC:** Factor likely delayed QRF/MEDEVAC; stabilise casualties on site.
* **Post‑incident care:** mental health support for crews exposed to ambush/IED incidents.

---

## 9. Intelligence & Pattern Analysis

* Map incidents to identify: emplacement clusters, cell operating areas, trigger‑techniques, and supplier patterns.
* Correlate with HUMINT (local elders), SIGINT intercepts, and patrol observations to prioritize investigative and targeting actions.

---

## 10. Commander's Key Directives (One‑line actionables)

* **Always assume secondary devices.** Treat initial device scenes as potential bait for follow‑on attacks.
* **Enforce route unpredictability.** Vary movement patterns and conduct advance recon.
* **Do not touch — call EOD.** No exceptions.
* **Use local intel but verify.** Rely on at least two corroborating sources before kinetic follow‑up.
* **Prioritise force protection — hold for EOD and medical stabilisation first.**

---

## Annex — Quick Checklist for Patrol Leaders

* Pre‑movement: brief likely IED sectors, alternate routes, medevac and EOD contact info.
* During movement: maintain spaced intervals, overwatch, and eyes on likely concealment points.
* On suspicion: stop, mark, cordon, notify EOD, establish security, preserve evidence, prepare CCP.
* After event: document, report, debrief, and update route IED map.

**Final note:** This brief is defensive: it focuses on detection, mitigation, reporting, and exploitation. All technical render‑safe actions remain the sole responsibility of qualified EOD/engineer teams under established SOP and legal authority.
